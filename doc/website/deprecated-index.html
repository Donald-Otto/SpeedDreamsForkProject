	<a name="1"><h1>Welcome to Speed Dreams, an Open Motorsport Sim !</h1></a>
	<p>Speed Dreams
is a fork of the famous open racing car simulator TORCS, aiming to implement
exciting new features, cars, tracks and AI opponents to make a more
enjoyable game for the player, as well as constantly improving visual and physics realism.</p>
	<p>In other words, Speed Dreams is the place:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>where developers can try their ideas and have every chance to get them released to the end-users 
			(<strong>democracy</strong> is the main principle ruling the dev team),</li>
		<li>where end-users can enjoy the completion of these ideas and give their opinion about it, and/or make new suggestions.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>So,
if you find your or some people's Torcs patch proposals don't integrate
the official release as quickly as you would have loved, you have
reached the right place !</p>
		
	<a name="2"><h1>How to contribute</h1></a>
	<p>You can contribute to Speed Dreams as an "end-user" and / or as a "developer":</p>
	<ul>
		<li>as an end-user (check <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=239111">the Download page on SF.net</a> for how to get source / binary releases and <a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/speed-dreams">our Wiki (under construction)</a> to get more information on the project):
			<ul>
				<li>help the dev team to test pre-releases</li>
				<li>suggest improvements, express your support or disgust about changes</li>
				<li>ask questions about compilation / build from source problems</li>
				<li>...</li>
			</ul>
			all through our users mailing list: <a href="mailto:speed-dreams-users@lists.sourceforge.net">speed-dreams-users@lists.sourceforge.net</a>
			or our <a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/speed-dreams">bug / feature tracker</a></li>
			or our <a href="http://chat.jabberfr.org/muckl_int/index.php?room=speed-dreams-users">users chat room on JabberFr</a></li>
		<li>as a developer (see <a href="http://sourceforge.net/svn/?group_id=239111">the Code menu in SF.net</a> for how to get the source tree from the Subversion repository):
			<ul>
				<li>as guest contributor, you may propose your adds / improvements as <strong>patches</strong> (patch files built via diff -Naur or equivalent) against the latest source tree, 
					and send them to us as attached files through our devel mailing list <a href="mailto:speed-dreams-devel@lists.sourceforge.net">speed-dreams-devel@lists.sourceforge.net</a>
					or our <a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/speed-dreams">bug / feature tracker</a>;
					feel also free to join the dev. team daily discussions and monthly meetings in <a href="http://chat.jabberfr.org/muckl_int/index.php?room=speed-dreams-dev">our developers char room on JabberFr</a>;
you don't have write access yet to the SVN repository, but it's up to
you to prove us your skills and innovation ability as a programmer, a
software architect, an artist, ... as well as your self-discipline in
testing ;-) ... and that way, you may enter step by step in the dev.
team ...</li>
				<li>as
a registered developer, you now have write access to the SVN
repository and can simply commit your adds / improvements ;
that way, they can be easily tested and reviewed by anyone
updating his working copy of the source tree; but be responsible, never forget
that <strong>democracy</strong> is the main rule in the dev. team, 
so, before committing and even begining to work on, explain first
the details of your project, ask everyone's opinion ...
enjoy each other skills and thoughts to improve your work !
And you're likely to endorse some particular development mission
or become the recognized expert of the team on some subject ...</li>
			</ul>
	</li></ul>
	<p> <br />Your contribution to Speed Dreams may take place in many domains :</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The
core code itself, and its numerous subjects : user interface, physics
engine, 3D graphics engine, race managment, input device related code,
file formats, ... to enhance, optimize, make more up-to-date, fix bugs,
port to another platform ...</li>
		<li>the robot(s) code (AI racing)</li>
		<li>the cars design or tuning</li>
		<li>the tracks design</li>
		<li>the documentation</li>
		<li>... feel free to suggest ...</li>
	</ul>

	<a name="3"><h1>Speed Dreams release process</h1></a>
	<p>Speed Dreams
won't follow Torcs release stream : we plan to adopt a pace&nbsp;of 1 or 2 releases a year,
and to simply integrate&nbsp;all interesting changes / fixes that Torcs would have released
meanwhile.</p>
	<p>As already said, the content of each release will be <strong>democratically</strong>
decided inside the dev team. Stability and bug freeness is not our
first purpose, but it's just the second one: modifications that are not
really completed, well tested or that may degrade the simulation
realism, some other essential feature or performance, or the end-user
gaming experience, ... won't be released (unless they are of great interest
and can be completely switched off through some menu button or keyboard shortcut).</p>
For the moment, the supported platforms are Linux (x86, x86_64) and 32 bit
Windows XP and Vista ; the Mac OS X port is 95% finished, but volunteers are welcome for any other ...

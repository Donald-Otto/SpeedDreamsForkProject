   and backfire and brakelight textures (Andrew)
- integrated SuperChamp race mode and full car set by Andrew Sumner (Xavier)

  changed speed digital indicator color to red (more visible) (Jean-Philippe)
- added 1936 Grand Prix carset(Andrew)
- updated SuperCars cars textures by Eckhard M. Jager - Work in progress (Jean-Philippe)
- removed cars not belonging to SuperCars, 36 Grand-Prix and TRB1 car sets
  (actually moved to the dead branch "legacy")
- added a default 3D wheel model to data/data/textures and data/data/objects,
  (as well as a default tex-wheel.rgb/png for auto-generated wheel model),
  and removed 3D wheel model from all cars (but 36GP) as they are all the same one (but for 36GP),
  now shipped and searched in data/data/textures and data/data/objects ;
  also removed now useless tex-wheel.rgb from all cars (Jean-Philippe)
- set fictious brand and model names for all cars, based on ideas from the whole team,
  to avoid legal issues ; the real brand name replacements follows (Andrew, Jean-Philippe) :
  * Alfa Romeo 		=> Milano		
  * Aston Martin 	=> Archer
  * Auto Union 		=> Motor Union
  * Audi 		=> Vieringe
  * Bugatti 		=> Ettore
  * Any GM brand 	=> Deckard, except for Corvettes, which will be Vultures.
  * GM/Corvette		=> Vulture
  * Dodge 		=> Taipan
  * ERA 		=> Century

  * Mosler 		=> ?
  * Saleen 		=> ?
  * Venturi 		=> ?
  * Fiat		=> ?
  * ?			=> Sector
  * ?			=> Zaxxon.
- fixed out of bound setup parameters for SuperCars
- changed TRB1 tyre textures to the new slick ones by Haruna Say (Haruna)
- removed remaining real brand/model names and logos from textures
  (sc-nsx, 36 GP, ...) (Haruna, Eckhard, Xavier)
- removed Torcs references from textures (Haruna, Eckhard, Xavier)
- move Torcs-NG references to "Speed Dreams" (Haruna, Eckhard, Xavier)

Robots:
- fixes for Autoclutch, ABS and ASR in human driver (Andrew)
- integrated K1999 (Windows) (Jean-Philippe)
- integrated and tuned USR robot for 1936 Grand Prix, TRB1 and SuperCars carsets (Andrew)
- integrated and tuned Simplix robot for 1936 Grand Prix, TRB1 and SuperCars car sets
  (Wolf-Dieter)
- removed old robots from trunk :
  * only kept simplix_GP36, simplix_trb1, simplix_sc, and usr_GP36, usr_trb1, usr_sc
    as first class AI opponents to human drivers for 36GP, SC and TRB1 car sets
  * and also bt and K1999, as educational bases for robot develpment
    (these 2 ones are normally not built ; to build them under Windows,
     use "prebuild.bat unmaintained" and speed-dreams-unmaintained.sln ;
     under Linux/Mac, you must change src/drivers/Makefile)
  * actually, the old robots where not removed, but moved to the dead branch named "legacy".
- enabled Simplix and USR robots to be members of mixed teams,
  through new team management interface in RobotTools (Wolf-Dieter)

Menus:
- splash screen / icons in NG variants by Eckhard M. Jager (Eckhard, Xavier, Jean-Philippe) 
- integrated Simu V3 and resurected Simulation menu by Cristos Dimitrakakis (Jean-Philippe)
- applied GearChangeMode patch, that adds support for grid shifting (Jean-Philippe)
- more resolutions available under Windows in Options/Display menu (Jean-Philippe)
- updated race results and standings menus in order to display the driver "type"
  and used car for each driver (Jean-Philippe)
  (driver "type" extracted from driver module name cut on the last "_" if any, 
  for "ubiquitous" robots, or on the last char if it is an isolated digit, 
  for other robots with duplicate code)
- improved the "driver select" menu and displayed info about car and driver type (Jean-Philippe)
  * added "car category" and "driver type" filters for the "not selected" driver scroll-list
  * hidden useless (?) "Set Focus" button
  * replaced highlighted driver name by its driver type (name already displayed)
  (the "driver type" is actually the robot/AI code, like Simplix, USR, Berniw, Hymie)
- simplified race loading screen messages, and added a "Loading cars"
  for the user to be aware of what's happening during the sometimes 10s-long delay
  just before "Ready" ; displayed the real name of the cars, not their XML files's one (Jean-Philippe)
- optimized "track select" menu load time, by loading track / category XML file
  only when needed, that is when the user changes the filtering combo-boxes,
  and no more all the files at the beginning, which was now quite long (Jean-Philippe).
- added a "Credits" multi-page menu to list all contributors, contributions
  and 3rd party libs / code / software we use.
- new modes for the race screen leader board (Gabor)
  * vertically scrolling : list of competitors, text in associated color,
  * horizontally scrolling : just as on TV (WIP).
- resurected the "Configure player" button in the Raceman menu, to avoid returning
  to the Main menu for that (Jean-Philippe).
- show a special track preview image + track outline when changing the selected track
  in the "Track select" menu (Brian, Jean-Philippe) ; created nice preview images for that (Andrew).
- now, menu background images no longer need to be 2^n x 2^p ; artists can submit them in the desired size, without any artificial compression that may loose details (Jean-Philippe, Brian)
- whole menu refresh, though XML descriptors infrastructure (backround images, menu controls and colors, limited re-layout, ...) (Eckhard, Brian)

Program:
- applied animated driver patch by Andrew Sumner (Xavier, andrew)
- applied 3D-Wheel patch by Eric Espie (Xavier)
- GCC 4.3 compatibility (Xavier, Mart and Jean-Philippe)
- fixed "deprecated conversion from string constant to char*" everywhere with GCC (Mart)
- Moved to MSVC 2005 (Pro, Express+Win32 SDK) and fixed many warnings
  (Andrew, Brian, Jean-Philippe)
- renamed config.h to config-win32.h into repository to avoid committing it
  under Linux, where it is generated ; under Windows, config-win32.h
  is renamed to config.h by prebuild.bat (Jean-Philippe)
- simuv2 update from far better (than 1.3.1) Torcs trunk, plus addition of 
  enhancements from simuv3 (Andrew).
- models and textures no longer load for races in "results only" mode (Andrew)
- applied single processor affinity patch (only for Windows Vista / 7
  otherwise rendering is jerky with multi-core CPUs) (Andrew, Xavier, Jean-Philippe)
- spinning the drive wheels will now generate smoke (Andrew)
- F2 camera views - order changed, and "driver" view modified to look in the 
  direction the car's turning - work in progress (Andrew)
- renamed setup_win32.....bat files to prebuild...bat and postbuild...bat
  (simpler names for easier selection in the explorer ; 
   2 useless files removed, now only 4) (Jean-Philippe)
- applied NoMaxModuleInterfaces patch, that breaks the 10-limit of the maximum number
  of interfaces a Speed Dreams run-time loadable module can have, 
  thus enabling robot modules for an unlimited number of cars (Jean-Philippe)
- enhanced module management and module interface (in a backward compatible way) :
  a module can export 3 fixed named functions, "moduleWelcome" being called by Speed Dreams
  just after loading the DLL for exchanging information (in and out), "moduleInitialize"
  being called to initialize the tModInfo list (as usual, but now with unlimited size),
  "moduleTerminate" being called just before the DLL unload.
  in other words, new module interface fixed-name scheme : moduleWelcome (pre-initialization
  Speed Dreams <=>  module data exchange), moduleInitialize (replaces <module name>())
  and moduleTerminate (replaces <module name>Shut()) ; usefull for building ubiquitous
  robots that can be multiplicated by simple DLL copy+rename (with different data)
  (Jean-Philippe).
- fixed slightly weak / unclear brake light rendering on some cars (Wolf-Dieter ?)
- applied "FPS average" computation and console output patch by Mart Kelder (Jean-Philippe)
- applied "Max gears" unification patch by Mart Kelder (Jean-Philippe)
- unified font and default vertical position of the speed and gear digital indicators
  displayed on the speedometer and tachometer (Jean-Philippe)
- moved user settings files to <My documents>/speed-dreams.settings under Windows,
  to enable multiple users to have different settings on the same computer ;
  implemented in a XP / Vista / 7 and any-locale compatible way (Jean-Philippe)
- now, all cars have a default 3D wheel model (wheel*.ac*, wheel3d.png)
  shipped (and searched at run-time) in data/data/textures and in data/data/objects (Jean-Philippe)
- added Linux -DSPEED_DREAMS compile option for Torcs backward compatibility,
  useful for robot code as an example (under Windows, this needs to be set inside each needed .vcproj)
- enabled mouse buttons as normal controls ; replaced mouse right click in race mode by the "o" keyboard shortcup to hide the mouse cursor (usefull for screenshots) (Jean-Philippe).
- fixed dead zone not taken into account for analog joysticks (Jean-Philippe).

Other:
- migrated from CVS to SVN for the fork from Torcs (Xavier, Jean-Philippe)
- torcs => speed-dreams where strictly necessary, noticeably for starting scripts
  under Linux, to enable smooth cohabitation with Torcs in the same installation
  directory and user home directory (Xavier, Jean-Philippe)
- added -v option to Linux speed-dreams script, to run under "valgrind --leak-check=full"
- updated and improved Windows installer (simpler configuration, new images and logos, ...) (Xavier, Jean-Philippe)
- setup Trac bug / feature tracker and simple development Wiki on SF.net (Jean-Philippe)
- upload screenshots on SF.net (Jean-Philippe)
- advertising about the release everywhere (Sebastian, Xavier, Eckhard, Kilo, Brian, Jean-Philippe)


                               *****************************

Remaining TODO list for 1.4.0:
------------------------------

Tracks:

Cars:
- check light definitions for SuperCars, and other car sets ? (Wolf-Dieter ?)
- improve 36GP car gauges textures
- check if adding cars in data/cars/models without adding the associated category file
  in data/cars/categories really makes the game crash when entering the Player configuration menu

Robots:
- fix Simplix crashing in race mode when track has no / not enough pit places (Wolf-Dieter)
- move Simplix wheel textures to 3D wheels scheme (tex-wheel.rgb =  * wheel3d.png),
  as the current tex-wheel.rgb has been ignored since cars moved to 3D wheels
- fix undefined pit doors textures when pitsharing activated with robots from more than 1 team
  or multiple robots of the same team.

Menus:

Program:
- apply Christos fixes on Simu V3 for collision detection (already done ?)
- tests and bug fixes.

Sourceforge.net:
- setup bug tracker at least for the beta/rc release
- upload nice screen shots
